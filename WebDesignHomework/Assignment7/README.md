Hi! this week, I was really proud of the extra customization I did within the style section of the website. I learned how to center some things on my profiles page, and I also learned how to color link text! I made it orange, which is my favorite color, and it honestly made me super excited. I feel like it really enhanced my website by adding a little bit of personalization. The orange also helps tie together the color palette, making the site more visually satisfying.
