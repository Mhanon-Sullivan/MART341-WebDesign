<h1>Vesnik the Jank Deer</h1>
<h4>My Favorite Mascot</h4>
<p>Vesnik started out as a one-off character for a class project. I needed a character for a narrative project, and after a little bit of doodling, Vesnik the Jank Deer was born. Now, you may be wondering... why is he jank? What exactly <em>is</em> "jank"?</p>
<p>"Jank" is the term I use to describe something unusual or out of the ordinary; something rather broken or unlike its intended self. Vesnik is "jank" for a couple reasons: he's has bright orange fur and a magic third eye right in the middle of his forehead. He also holds many secrets yet to be discovered.</p>

<p>Below, you'll find Vesnik the star of his very own animation.</p>
