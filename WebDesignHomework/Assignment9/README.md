For my project, I chose to do a how-to guide on how to draw my Jank Deer. The materials are simple; just a pencil and some paper. 

Here are the steps:
1. Draw half of a bean shape 
2. Draw two beans on top of that and connect them with a line 
3. Draw two lines for the neck 
4. Draw a curved line for the back 
5. Draw a long triangle for the leg, then connect it to the front of the chest 
6. Draw a second leg behind the first 
7. Draw a leaf shape for the tail 
8. Draw a curved line beneath the tail to start the back leg 
9. Draw another curved line for the rest of the leg 
10. Draw a line for the stomach 
11. Draw another leg behind the first back leg 
12. Draw three eyes and a heart-shaped nose 
13. Fill in the details, like the curves of the ears, hooves, and heart-shaped fluff 
14. Finally, you can add antlers if you'd like! Draw two spiky curves and connect them to his forehead with some lines

I suppose the additional tip is step 14, because it's completely optional. The pictures wil sit with the text of every step.
