For this assignment, I'll be adjusting index.html


Required Techniques (Must Have):

Create a page with an external CSS style sheet - Completed

Add hover effects to enhance interactivity - This can be found at the bottom of the page (and the index.html) in the form of a button with a link that turns orange when you hover over it.

Use an external font that is self-hosted - See below
Use an external font from a font library - I used the font family "Arvo", which is from Google Fonts (the font library) and self-hosted it in my site.


Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

Experiment with different font styles - All of my headers are a bold/italic style of the base font, while everything else is the base font.

Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc. - All of my headers have been underlined with text decorations

Align text or elements for a clean layout - My main header is alligned to the center, as is the image of the deer and the button element at the bottom with the transformX property. Everything else is aligned to the left for ease of readability.
