At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme. Completed.

Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices. Yep! the media queries are in style.css, and I'm mostly certain that they work like they're supposed to! And as far as I can tell, the site is responsive across screen sizes.


Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site. Yep! You'll find this on every page to make navigation easier. I made it vertical because I think it flows nicely.

Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable. My dropdown leads to the video page!
