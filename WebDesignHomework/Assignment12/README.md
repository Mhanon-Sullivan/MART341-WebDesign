For this assignment, I'll be adjusting index.html through style.css

Select at least 6 of the following techniques to implement:

Sizing – header and .main both have their widths controlled by percentage, as does the image.

Overflow – .main has its overflow set to be hidden, to help make it obvious if I make the list exceedingly long.

Border – All of the elements have a solid red border to help emphasize the orange color. This red matched the red found in the lineart of the deer image -- for consistency!

Margin – All of the elements have a margin element to help space them out.

Padding – The header, .main, and .button all have padding.

Position – the header and .main both have relative position elements.
