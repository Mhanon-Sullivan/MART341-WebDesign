# Week 3 Reflection
#### *Work Summary*

This week, I was excited to work more with markup language because I had quite a bit of fun with it last week. Here, I worked with markup language in a README file -- the attributes are as follows: 
- **bold text**
- *italic text*
- different sizes of headings
- a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)
- a picture
- a paragraph.

I don't believe I have any questions so far, but I'll be sure to send any your way if I do. I also didn't have any problems.
