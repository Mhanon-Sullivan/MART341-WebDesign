Three or more pages. - I've got four!

A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability. - I'd certainly say so!

Use of an external stylesheet. - It can be found under style.css in the style folder.

Apply at least one font. - Yes! it can be found in the fonts folder (Arvo).

At least one image (preferably your own or fair-use images). - Yep! My deer can be found at the bottom of index.html.

At least one embedded media element (video, audio, Google Maps, etc.). - I have two embedded iframe videos in video.html.

Structural and semantic HTML markup with a clean and organized page layout. - div tags are used throughout the project, and tags such as h2, li, ul, etc, are also used consistently for content identification.

Legible, well-commented, and error-free code. - I'd say that my code is both legible and error-free, and I have made comments throughout my work.
