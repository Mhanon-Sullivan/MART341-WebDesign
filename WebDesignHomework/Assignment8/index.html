    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
    <h2>I'm so glad you're here!</h2>

    <!-- Below is an image of me (far left) and some of my friends (from left to right; Elena, Ro, Sasha)! I wanted to include a picture because pictures are the heart of this blog. I also used the css "width" to make the picture a little smaller. -->

    <img src="images/friends.jpg" alt="An image of, from left to right, Nonni, Elena, Ro, and Sasha sitting in a car" title="Roadtrip with Elena, Ro, and Sasha!" width="400" height="">

     <p>This is a webiste that will focus on the things that my friends and I do together! <br />Along with <em>photos</em>, you'll find things such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <strong>
              <li>textposts</li>
              <li>quotes from songs I've been listening to recently</li>
              <li>and various other entries!</li>
            </strong>
        </ul>

    <p>You'll also meet my friends!</p>
    <!-- I though that it would be helpful here to note Katie and Hanna as my sisters; they don't appear often, but it's still nice to know some backstory! I actually have another sister, Julia, and a brother, Fox, but I never see them in person. They live too far away to get as many pictures as I do Katie and Hanna! Or any pictures, actually...-->

        <!-- Words cannot explain how much I love this video. I watch it all the time. I quote it just as often. You get to see it now, too. What better place to put it than a personal blog? You're welcome. -->
        <p>Next, I'll show you a video that means a whole lot to me. I hope you enjoy it, too,<br /> because I watch it at least twelve times a day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFEiX-rkdYQ&list=LL&index=32" target="_blank">My Favorite Video on YouTube</a></p>

        <p>Below is a line from a song that I've had on repeat for a good, long while.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>
                    I never cared much for moonlit skies
                    <br />
                    I never winked back at fire flies
                    <br />
                    But now that the stars are in your eyes
                    <br />
                    I'm beginning to see the light
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I never went in for afterglow
                    <br />
                    Or candlelight on the mistletoe
                    <br />
                    But now when you turn the lamp down low
                    <br />
                    I'm beginning to see the light
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Used to ramble through the park
                    <br />
                    Shadowboxing in the dark
                    <br />
                    Then you came and caused a spark
                    <br />
                    That's a four-alarm fire now
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I never made love by lantern shine
                    <br />
                    I never saw rainbows in my wine
                    <br />
                    But now that your lips are burning mine
                    <br />
                    I'm beginning to see the light
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - I'm Beginning to See the Light - The Ink Spots ft. Ella Fitzgerald
