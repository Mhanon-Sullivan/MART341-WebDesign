Div (at least 2): In my project, I used multiple div tags, including "navigation", "timer", "media", and "caption". I used these specific tags to organize parts of the website into managable, identifiable sections.

Span (at least 2): I used the span tag to implement italic emphasis within portions of text, such as in both caption classes.

Audio (at least 1): I implemented an audio clip of calming study music to go with the page's them of studying with my friend, Elena.

Video (at least 1): I also implemented a short video of Elena herself studying to emphasize the "studying" aspect of the page.

Iframe (at least 1): The iframe I used is a Pomodoro timer, a time-based method of studying that Elena uses frequently. The iframe allows for users to track their time when using this study method as well.

Class (at least 2): I used multiple classes, including "page-block, "left", and "emphasis". "Page-block" inserts a color block behind the features it's tied to. I used this in every div tag "Left" aligns features to the left, like with navigation. Finally, "emphasis" adds italics to whatever it's applied to. I used this in both span tags.

Escape character (at least 1): I used the escape character for "<" to make a cute heart in the caption of the video <3
