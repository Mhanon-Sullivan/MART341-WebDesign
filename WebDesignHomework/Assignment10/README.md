README List:

I will be working on a page focused on my love of the color orange. I really like the color orange.

Required Techniques (Must Have):

-Create a page with an external CSS style sheet: Completed
-Use at least 1 class selector: This can be found in style.css as ".main". This is for organization.

Use at least 1 ID selector: These can be found in style.css as "#para-1", "#para-2", and "#para-3". This is for organization as well.

Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

Different background colors: There is the base orange background, the white backgrounds behind the main text, and the lighter orange background behind the header. For contrast!

Different font colors: The header text is white, the main text is black, and though it is subtle, the paragraph text in the white boxes is a very dark grey. This adds contrast to the webpage.

Positioning: I positioned the deer image to the enter of the box for aesthetic reasons.

Opacity: This one is super subtle too; I looked through a css book and found how to add brown backshadows to the white boxes, which utilize low opacity. I think it adds a lot of style.

Text Alignment: The header text is aligned to the center, while everything else is aligned to the left. This is for balance.
