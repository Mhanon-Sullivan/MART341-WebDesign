<h1>Why I Picked These Website Ideas</h1>


<h4>Personal Blog</h4>
<p>I thought to do a personal blog because I really love documenting what my <br />friends and I do together. I've been dubbed as the photographer of the group, <br />and I'm constantly being asked to send pictures to our group chat. A good way <br />to remedy this is with a website that my friends can go to and pull pictures <br />from directly. It's also a great way to document our friendship and my day-to-day <br />life.</p>

<h4>Art Portfolio</h4>
<p>I thought to do an art portfolio because I need a storage system for my art that <br />is both aesthetically pleasing and easily-accessible by others. I want people to <br />see my work. As an animator, I need a place for employers to go to see what I <br />can do, and a portfolio page would do excactly that.</p>

<h4>Cat Blog</h4>
<p>I thought to do a cat blog because I want to create a storage system of photos <br />of my cat, William. I have hundreds of photos and would love to organize <br />them. It's like his own personal section of a scrapbook, except the whole <br />scrapbook is his (as it should be).</p>
