<h4>Personal Blog</h4>
<p>A personal blog would describe day-to-day personal updates. I would include <br />
    things like what I did during the day, photos of my activities, as well as <br />photos of my friends. I'm with my friends frequently throughout the day, so it <br />would be a nice way to document the things that we do together. I could also <br />share it with my friends to view! It's like a digital scrapbook. The tone would <br />be fun and playful.</p>

<h4>Art Portfolio</h4>
<p>An art portfolio would serve as a hub for my artwork. I can upload works as I <br />create them and have a visual history of my progress all in one place. It <br />would also serve as a good way to display my work for others to view it. The <br />tone would be professional, but fun enough to show my personality as it <br />applys to my art.</p>

<h4>Cat Blog</h4>
<p>A cat blog would focus on my cat, William. It would consist mainly of photos <br />of him as he exists throughout the day. Like the personal blog, this would be <br />something like a digital scrapbook. The tone would be playful and happy.</p>
