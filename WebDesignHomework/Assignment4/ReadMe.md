## Week 4 Questions

1. Web Browsers work by translating various web languages into their intended visualizations for use by the public. They also fetch and retrieve IP addresses to help users easily navigate to their desired webpages.

2. The DOM (Document Object Model) is an essential step in creating a webpage that is, at its core, a structural base for a webpage and its contents; it allows for its contents to be properly sorted and displayed. It is NOT, however, your source code.

3. HTML, XML, and XHTML are set apart by various functions. HTML is used to display document nodes, XML is meant to describe them, and XHTML is a functionally more time-consuming combination of the other two. This is because it is more precise.

4. The four essential elements that every HTML page needs are the document type, the root, the head, and the body.

5. The purpose of the index.html page is to act as the master page/foundation for the website. It's your home page. It holds all of the data required to create the content and physical structure for the webpage. It should always be stored in the root of the directory tree.

6. The top naming practices for clean and organized code are consistency in file-naming (such as always having lowercase letters or using camel-casing) having files sorted into a proper folder system, and never using spaces or strange characters in your file names.
