3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme. - Completed

Framework Integration – I used Bootstrap! the css links can be found at the top of every page for both .css and .js.

Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal. - I used a Bootstrap text styling for all my secondary text. It helps differentiate it from the header text by making it smaller and lighter.

HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations. - You can find this on on my contact.html page. It's a transparent canvas with a colored border and text inside of it. It's a different font and color to emphasize how much we love your feedback!

JavaScript Functionality – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site. - I have the .js Bootstrap link on every page, and have used JavaScript to make the canvas/text on the contact page.
