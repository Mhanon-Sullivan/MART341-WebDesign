I'm choosing to create a site that focuses on photos of my friends and I; it'll be like a personal blog. I'll upload pictures of what we do together, and add textposts describing day-to-day occurences. I want it to be playful in tone, yet clean and respectable. I'm choosing to do this because creating a site around my dearest friends sounds delightful.

Reflection:

I personally think I've achieved a nice amount of balance within my website. Though not particularly symmetrical, the site does utilize a balance between whitespace and otherwise. Adjusting the background color to a peachy-beige allowed for the site to seem fuller, if that makes sense. It's not as empty as it was with the white. Adjusting the width of the picture was also crucial; it was way too big before and it threw of the visual balance immensely. Shrinking it down to the width of the text made the whole thing look harmonious.

I feel as though the final design was the initial design as well. I don't know if I actually started with a design in mind, actually. I just kept building and reordering until I was satisfied with the layout in front of me.

I didn't face a single problem this time around! I actually had a lot of fun with this project in particular; I enjoyed building it from the ground up. In the future, I'm excited to work more with CSS, as I believe learning it would boost my site to a higher visual level.

I would also like to note that my image is from my desktop, not linked from a website. The image will be uploaded to GitHub in a folder under Assignment6, so there shouldn't be any issues, but please let me know if you if you can't see it. I'll do what I can to fix it for you!
